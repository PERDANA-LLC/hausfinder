### What I've Built for You

This isn't a mockup or wireframe—it's a fully functional property listing platform tailored specifically for the Solomon Islands market:

**Core Features Already Implemented:**
- Property listings for rentals and sales in Honiara
- Multi-image uploads with cloud storage (S3)
- Advanced search and filtering by property type, status, price, and bedrooms
- Interactive Google Map of Honiara with property markers
- User authentication system
- Favorites/saved properties functionality
- Contact forms with owner notifications
- AI-powered property description generator
- User dashboard for managing listings
- Full admin dashboard for user and content management
- Mobile-first, responsive design optimized for lower bandwidth
- Dark/light theme toggle

**Tech Stack:**
- React 19 + TypeScript (modern, maintainable)
- tRPC for type-safe APIs
- MySQL database with Drizzle ORM
- Tailwind CSS 4 for styling
- Google Maps integration
- S3 for image storage

### Why Me?

I'm a newcomer to Upwork, which means:
- **No Job Success Score yet** — I'm being transparent about this
- **I'm hungry to prove myself** — I built your entire MVP before you even hired anyone
- **You get exceptional value** — I'm willing to work within your budget to earn my first review

I'm based in Orlando, Florida, USA, and I'm fully committed to making this project a success.

### Is This What You Want?

Take a look at the live demo. If it matches your vision, we can move forward immediately. If you'd like modifications, I'm happy to adjust the platform to your exact specifications.

I'm ready to:
- Customize the design and branding
- Add or remove features based on your feedback
- Provide ongoing support and maintenance
- Train you on the admin dashboard

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,
Thomas

## Key Differentiator

Most freelancers will send you a proposal promising to build something. I'm sending you a **working product** you can test right now. This demonstrates:

1. **Technical competence** — I can actually deliver
2. **Initiative** — I invest in opportunities I believe in
3. **Speed** — The MVP is already done
4. **Commitment** — I'm serious about earning your business

## Questions for You

1. Does the current design align with your brand vision?
2. Are there any features you'd like to add or remove?
3. Do you have existing branding (logo, colors) to integrate?
4. What's your preferred timeline for going live?
